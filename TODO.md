# TODO List

Cause I don't use Taiga, Trello or any other places for project management quite yet...

## In Progress

[ ] - jenkins integration
[ ] - figure out way to download extensions without extending image each time (Go Binary, build Docker image yourself?)

## Completed

[ ] [Kubernetes Manifests - moved to own branch @ collegis-git.deltakedu.corp/dustinliddick](add proper URL here)

## Deprecated

[ ] mkdocs.yml - not needed at this time
